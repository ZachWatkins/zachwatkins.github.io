I am building a dashboard for our family computer. It will help my family get excited about things coming up and to stay organized. Maybe it can help yours too.

Do you want a way to share fun and important information with the people in your house on a single shared screen?

I do. That's why I'm building Rememboard ([on GitHub](https://github.com/zachwatkins/rememboard)) to be a dashboard for the home computer. It will show things like:

- Days until your next big event or trip.
- A quiet time widget to let everyone know when it's too loud.
- A map of all the places you've traveled together.
- Daily task or chore lists for each person.
- What's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- The weather, so everyone knows what to wear.
- A calendar to keep track of important activities that day.

You can follow my progress by viewing articles tagged ["rememboard"](/articles/tags/rememboard/). I'll be using Laravel, InertiaJS, and React to build it and I'll host it locally on an extra computer in our house.

I'd like to thank [Jason McCreary](https://jasonmccreary.me/) for making [Blueprint](https://blueprint.laravelshift.com/) which has saved me time with generating boilerplate code on several projects, including this one. I really favor code generation solutions these days (see why [here](/articles/coding-without-typing/)). I'm trying to make an InertiaJS and React addon for it, but in a private repo since it's not functional yet.
