# WordPress vs VitePress For Developer Blogs

While migrating my personal website to VitePress, I've noticed several things WordPress does well by default that (for now) I'm missing in VitePress.

I chose VitePress because I plan to spend most of my time creating technical content for this site. This kind of content is much easier to create with my code editor than the WordPress editor. I also wanted the files related to each post to be in their own directories, which is not possible with WordPress due to how it stores post data and media files.

## What WordPress Does Better than VitePress

1. SEO
2. Paginated post list pages
3. Post Search
4. Post Category Pages
