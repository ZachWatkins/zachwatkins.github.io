We always plan to succeed, but are you also planning for failures? Learn effective risk management strategies for designing fault-tolerant applications and websites at every level of the stack. Consider the opportunities for predicting, preventing, and transferring risk - and then failing gracefully when an incident occurs. These strategies will be presented using an in-production full stack sensor data application hosted on Azure as a case study. This presentation will give developers and leaders real-world examples to learn from when adding resiliency to your own projects.
