Can we get this report for every county in the state? Yes! Learn how Adobe InDesign can quickly turn every row in a spreadsheet into documents for decision-makers. Hear how we use this process to provide county-level rail safety incident reports for rail safety inspectors with just an hour of work for each update. We will go over solutions for charts, overflow text, image selection, and accessibility which are crucial for most use cases. Slides are available. It was originally presented to the Texas A&M University System on Tuesday, February 25, 2025 from 11:00am to 11:45am CST at the annual Tech Summit conference. Speaker introduction by Kris Guye.
