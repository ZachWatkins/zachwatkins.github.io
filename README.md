# Personal Website for Zachary Watkins

This website hosts my most relevant work, skills, writings, experiences, and more.

## Technology

1. [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) for static site generation
2. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for templating and reactive components
3. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
4. [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) for image processing during the build step

## Directory Structure

This website uses VitePress for static site generation from markdown files. See [VitePress - Routing](https://vitepress.dev/guide/routing) for more information.

- `.github` - GitHub Actions workflows and other integration files.
- `.vitepress` - VitePress theme and configuration files.
