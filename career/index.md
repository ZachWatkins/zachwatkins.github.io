## Introduction

<a href="/profile.jpg" class="md:float-left md:mr-8 md:mb-4" title="Zach in Fall of 2021 wearing a suit jacket and buttoned-up shirt"><img style="display:inline-block" src="/img/profile/profile-214x300.jpg" alt="Zach in Fall of 2021 wearing a suit jacket and buttoned-up shirt" width="214" height="300" /></a>

I am a software engineer for Texas A&M Transportation Institute with 18 years of experience providing websites and web applications for the public and private sector. I have a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Angelo State University and have been a public speaker on technical subjects since 2015. In my current role I work with engineers and researchers to save time, lives, and resources by developing custom technology solutions for transportation research grants.

I’ve developed for more than 1,400 high-traffic websites and applications for public and private sector clients. In my freelance work I meet with clients, discuss their problems, requirements, and limitations, and we come up with a solution that meets their needs while being mindful of its impact on the long term cost of ownership of their web technology. I am happiest when my work is saving people a significant amount of time or makes their work and lives easier.

For frameworks I primarily use Laravel and React and am comfortable picking up new JavaScript and PHP frameworks. I have experience modernizing PHP and JavaScript code and am able to develop with or without frameworks depending on a project’s needs due to a thorough understanding of the languages. I spend most of my time developing and implementing application features and communicating with clients to ensure these solutions meet their needs. I also have experience with web design and CSS frameworks and have a BFA in graphic design, and although my most valuable work typically comes from producing features I am also responsible for their appearance.

## Accomplishments

In 2023 I developed a process for creating factsheets for every county in Texas using a data set, a NodeJS command line application I wrote, and Adobe InDesign in a way that only takes an hour to update across 5 different templates. In 2025 I added a feature to the NodeJS application to generate bar charts for each document. You can read about it here: [Document Automation with Adobe InDesign](/presentations/document-automation-with-adobe-indesign/).

In 2022 I refactored the data import and certification processes for an Internet of Things sensor data application to reduce runtimes from 4 hours to 5 minutes and wrote a database connection circuit breaker process in PHP to recover from transient connection issues during high-throughput operations which trigger load balancing.

In 2021 I rebuilt an in-house Ruby on Rails workstation ordering application in PHP for WordPress which launched that Fall. This application provides a manageable, authenticated storefront for the College of Liberal Arts’ faculty and staff workstation ordering program.

In 2020 I developed a custom WordPress theme based on the Genesis framework for Texas A&M AgriLife’s News website (https://agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/) and launched it that year.

In 2016 I developed and implemented a continuous deployment workflow for all of AgriLife’s custom WordPress plugins and themes to deploy to an array of single and multisite installations totaling 1,000+ sites, 3,000+ users, and 100,000+ unique monthly visits.

## Experience

**Texas A&M Transportation Institute**  
_November 2021 – present &bull; Software Engineer III_

I work in the Communication division to create web applications and provide other technology solutions for transportation research grants. I meet with division heads, principal investigators, researchers, and project managers to discuss goals, requirements, limitations, estimates, and provide progress updates.

I am responsible for development, deployment, and maintenance of the applications and sites I work on which are hosted on Azure, AWS, or WP Engine. I also work with researchers to implement their statistical calculations into application code or refactor their SQL to work more efficiently when driven by the application. I manage student technicians who contribute to my projects and previously managed a full-time employee.

To date, I have created or developed 12 different applications related to research grants and assisted with several internal websites. During this work I created ETL data pipelines, database migrations, a machine learning model trained on user inputs, and a rail safety factsheet generation process using Adobe InDesign. I also helped establish a data-sharing program with a Federal agency.


**Freelance WordPress Developer**  
_October 2011 – March 2023 &bull; Owner_

I provided development, support, and consultation for several local businesses. My last client whom I worked with for more than a year was a real estate agency with a WordPress website. I refactored their custom CRM workflow to improve performance, security, and reliability, and then added unit tests to expedite testing this and future modifications. I also implemented version control, SSH push deployment, custom AJAX driven search pages, and performance optimizations.

**Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts Dean’s Office**  
_November 2020 – November 2021 &bull; Software Applications Developer II_

I was the Lead Web Applications Developer for the Dean’s Office at the College of Liberal Arts. I completely rebuilt a critical self-hosted Ruby on Rails and Kubernetes application using PHP and WordPress to remove obstacles to its management and maintenance. I also moved their WordPress multisite network from self-hosted Kubernetes to WP Engine, performed security upgrades, implemented Active Directory authentication for WordPress users, and created and contributed to standard operating procedures for website governance.

**Texas A&M AgriLife Communications**  
_April 2015 – November 2020 &bull; Software Applications Developer II_

I was the lead developer for building, deploying, and maintaining in-house WordPress plugins and responsive themes in a way that minimized production cycles and was intuitive to content owners. I consulted with clients to scope work and create project plans. I was responsible for bringing our plugins and themes to meet accessibility and privacy regulations. I evaluated new technologies to implement into our workflow and gained experience working independently, remotely, and in an Agile environment. I established a continuous deployment and release pipeline for our repositories with automated tests and an average 7 minute lead time. I created performant, responsive, and branded themes used by agrilifetoday.tamu.edu, aglifesciences.tamu.edu, agrilife.tamu.edu, and more than a thousand other sites with 100,000 average monthly visits. I developed shell scripts to perform network-wide analysis and documentation tasks. My most advanced WordPress plugin while there helped our e-learning unit create, manage, and display a searchable collection of publications. github.com/agrilife/agrilife-learn-epubs.

**Naked Lime Marketing**  
_March 2009 – April 2015 &bull; Web Developer_

I provided web solutions for clients in the automotive industry that drove leads and helped them stay competitive online. I advised management on a timeline and technology budget to fulfill client requirements and wrote contracts upon approval. I was responsible for designing, developing, and implementing new features and themes within the constraints of the in-house content management system. I Implemented and debugged site performance issues and third party features. I was rewarded for creating an inventory listing enhancement that adds individualized price, incentive, and third party data. This saved a contract with a large dealership group. I developed processes for implementing Google Maps and Analytics, created a feature to attach vehicle-specific information to customer leads, and implemented email campaign landing pages with lead-specific data.
